### From the book "The Elements of Computing Systems" by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken

A simple computer built from scratch. This project includes 6/12 chapters of the book. 
The project starts from making basic logic gates and ends to a functioning CPU. 
This project wasn't part of my school program even though it's used in over 100+ universities and high schools around the world. 
The students who take the course range from high school students to Ph.D. students to Google engineers.
